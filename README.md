## How to install (Raspberry Pi side)

- Autostart RaspberryCast at boot (added to /etc/rc.local)
- Reboot

You can review the [install script](https://github.com/kotl/RaspberryCast/blob/master/setup.sh).

# Remote control (mobile devices)

```
http://raspberrypi.local:2020/remote
```
Note that you can "Add to homescreen" this link
 
You can also use the Android application (link to Playstore at the top of the page)

You can configure RaspberryCast settings in the extension option page.

## Cast videos from computer

Works on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows (Python needed)

**Download**

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kotl/RaspberryCast/master/rcast.py
```

**Usage**

```
python rcast.py video.mkv <subtitle.srt>
```

Subtitles can be given as an optional second argument. If no subtitle argument is found, RaspberryCast will attempt to find a subtitle file with the same name as the video. In the case of TV shows and movies, RaspberryCast will attempt to match the video with an appropriate subtitle file. This behaviour can be disabled in the configuration file.

## Demos
